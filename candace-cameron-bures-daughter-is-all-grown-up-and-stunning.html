During a <a href=#>Harvest Show</a> interview in 2017, Natasha touched on how important faith has been in her life. "My faith, in general, has just been a huge part of my life ever since I was born," she detailed. "I grew up in a Christian household, I was raised by Christian parents, I went to a Christian school all the way up to 10th grade, so pretty much my entire life was always surrounded by it," Natasha added. She acknowledged there have been "bumps in the road" with her faith, but she always finds "my foundation in God."</p><p>Natasha also told <a href=#>Christian Post</a>&nbsp;in 2017, "Your faith is never going to be perfect. You have to work each and every day to grow that!" She explained her belief in the practice of asking questions and being open to "tough conversations," and that she "would encourage everyone to have those conversations and ask those questions." Natasha was raised in Los Angeles, and she admitted that it was sometimes "difficult being around a culture that isn't always agreeing with what you're being told at home." However, Natasha expressed her belief that despite that difficulty, "it's important to stick to what's right."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXBhZoB5e8KapZ2Zk5p6pK3Mnqmopl2XwrOx0mabmq2XncGmvoyiqmaZnKF6qL7OsKVmraBirq%2BwjKyrrqaenruoew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
