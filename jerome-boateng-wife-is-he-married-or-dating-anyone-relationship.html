Jérôme’s most recent romantic relationship was with Kasia Lenhardt.</strong></p><p>But tragedy struck: one week after the supposed breakup, Lenhardt was found dead in an apartment in Berlin. Boateng is, however, engaged to Rebecca Silvera, his long-term on-and-off sweetheart. Jérôme Agyenim Boateng, a German professional football player, was born on September 3, 1988.</p><p>Boateng began his professional career at Hertha BSC, making his Bundesliga debut in 2007. In 2010, he joined Manchester City in the Premier League, where he showcased his defensive abilities and speed. Boateng joined Bayern Munich in 2011. He established himself as a key element of Bayern’s defense, winning numerous Bundesliga championships and the UEFA Champions League.</p><p>Boateng has also played a significant role for the German national team, helping them win the FIFA World Cup in 2014. Boateng has also received various individual trophies over his career, including selection to the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA FIFPro World XI.</p><h2>Who Is Jérôme Boateng’s wife?</h2><p>According to many media sources, Jérôme Boateng is not currently married. According to accounts, he became engaged to his on-and-off sweetheart, Rebecca Silvera. The two have had an on-and-off relationship for a long time. It is believed that he proposed to her during her opulent 35th birthday celebration in mid-September.</p><p>Rebecca even published a photo from her birthday party on social media, which shows her wearing a magnificent engagement ring. Despite their engagement announcement, the couple’s wedding date has yet to be confirmed.</p><h2>Jérôme Boateng’s Dating Timeline</h2><p>Sherin Senler and Boateng had an on-and-off romance from 2007 to 2011, and again from 2013 to 2018. They have twin daughters. Despite repeated breakups owing to adultery charges, including a painful divorce in 2018 over Senler’s assault accusation, they never got married.</p><p>Following their breakup, Boateng dated Rebecca Silvera, but their relationship was brief and tumultuous, with Boateng admitting to infidelity with Kasia. He was also linked to Kasia Lenhardt, with whom he revealed his romance in 2020. However, their relationship worsened in December 2020 due to allegations of manipulation and blackmail, concluding in a bitter breakup in early 2021.</p><p>Boateng has been accused of adultery with other women, including model Gina-Lisa Lohfink, but denies the allegations. Sherin and Kasia have accused Boateng of persistent infidelity without naming the other parties involved. Jérôme Boateng was recently photographed with Bahraini footballer Hessa Alisa, but there is no evidence of a relationship, despite fan speculation.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Footballer</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Trending News</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Musa Hassan Cerai His Wife Elly Afizahwati Abdul Jalil?
