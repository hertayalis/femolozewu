One of the hallmarks of the rare successful adaptation of a game property is its lack of explanation of several things. The Harpers are one of those things in this case and — in the lore — they are a group with an immensely complex history.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=528 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>As shown in the story, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harpers</a> are a semi-secret organization dedicated to doing good throughout the land and are also known as “Those Who Harp.” They are also responsible for maintaining a balance between nature and civilization and, as in the film where (spoilers if you have not seen it, obviously) actor Chris Pine’s character struggles to make money, members of his Jedi-like organization have to ask nothing in return for help and must help others without any concern for how much something may cost.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DND-MTG-06.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DND-MTG-05.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DND-MTG-04.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DND-MTG-03.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DND-MTG-02.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DND-MTG-01.png><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Unlike their peers from the Star Wars franchise, only some Harpers have the ability to use magic and they do not maintain an official headquarters akin to the other exterminated and often resurrected groups’ temples. The closest thing is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twilight Hall</a>, which is part of a network of buildings within the city of Berdusk and even this is not known to every group member, as sometimes Harpers operate completely on their own or in small cells which are not necessarily aware of others who are nearby their locations.</p><p data-characters=518 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Whether we will see more of the group — or the fact its members are more often women — in a sequel remains to be seen. The directors of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves are up for it, though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they say</a> they were not planning for a franchise, and, if one were to happen, they would hope to stick with the same cast and characters in order to jump into a new story quickly. So, we could see Pine’s Edgin again, and, if so, they just may give him the ability to use some magic while on a new adventure.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>A television show is also being planned for Paramount Plus and it has a series order already, so stay tuned.
