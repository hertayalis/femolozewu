(St Clair/Macpherson/Prahl/Splash)</p><p>It was a good ol’ Jersey fist fight — in Italy.</p><p>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro got into what’s being called a “major fist fight” last night during the show’s filming in Italy.</p><p>Photos taken afterward show The Situation, who had the hood of a sweatshirt pulled over his head, with red marks on his face and Ronnie with what appeared to be fresh cuts on his knuckles.</p><p><a class=legacy-link href=#>PHOTOS: ‘JERSEY SHORE’ INVADES ITALY</a></p><p>The beatdown may have started after a blowout between Ronnie and Sammi, <a href=#>TMZ.com reported</a>.</p><p>The “Shore” cast already has stirred things up in the old country.</p><p>Earlier this month, Deena Cortese was helped back over a ledge by fellow guidette Samantha “Sammi Sweetheart” Giancola after she nearly took a spill while sightseeing in Florence.</p><p>The self-proclaimed “blast in a glass” decided to channel her inner daredevil when she climbed over the ledge and nearly plunged into Florence’s River Arno.</p><p>The cast also started a cross-town pizza war.</p><p>Ronnie, Pauly D and the rest of the cast went to work as apprentice pizzaioli at the locally popular O’ Vesuvio Pizzeria in the heart of Florence’s historic city center.</p><p>That led a rival pizzeria to shun shun the guidos and guidettes.</p><p>Just across the famous Ponte Vecchio bridge from O’Vesuvio, Munaciello Pizzeria has placed a bright green sign in their window that said, “Tamarri Americans? ‘Jersey Shore’ . . . no thank you. Only real Italian pizza,” according to various Italian newspapers. Tamarri is Italian slang that can be roughly translated as yokel or uncultured idiot.</p><p>And officials banned the meatball-loving, booze-swilling cast from shooting at some of the most famous locations in the Renaissance city — including the renowned Uffizi gallery and the sculpture-filled Boboli Gardens.</p><p>Mayor Matteo Renzi also declared the stars must not be filmed in bars and clubs that serve alcohol and must not be filmed drinking in public. He also said he wants the show to promote Italy and feature its culture, traditions and good food.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnJ7j25ma2xfn7Kzv8SyZKygn6eytHnToZxmq5mpwqLAyKilZqqfo7uqsYygnK1lmaN6p7XSrWSfoZedwW6%2BxKmmq6xf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
