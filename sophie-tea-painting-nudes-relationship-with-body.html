It’s been a huge journey and one I didn’t think I’d find so cathartic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a68645c4f654-twiggles-sophieteaimg0430.jpg><p id=e1R-mSdMBUc data-wc=62>"Painting nude women has taught me the importance of self-acceptance and self-love," Sophie continues. "As I’ve studied the intricacies of the human body, I’ve come to appreciate its resilience and strength. I’ve marvelled at the way muscles flexed and skin stretched, telling stories of life, love and survival. And with each painting completed, I felt a newfound sense of confidence and empowerment.</p><p id=ehsaMpV5HKP data-wc=21>"I am blessed to have a body that is healthy and allows me to live life to the full," she adds.</p><p id=esl45cCnOUu data-wc=8><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How rejecting clothing sizes made me happier</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Representing all bodies</strong></h3><p id=e6QPoQP5IdD data-wc=27>Sophie feels privileged to make a difference in the body-positive space, knowing that representation of all bodies is key when it comes to feeling good about ourselves.</p><p id=e-uKMKu2OVY data-wc=31>"When I was younger, I don’t recall having representation to turn to and whilst everyone is aware that diversity hasn’t always been well represented, I want to redirect this to positivity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9206ddb128dd-twiggles-sophieteaimg9963-2.jpg><p id=e3dgw0_-P3B data-wc=43>"I’ve met hundreds of women who have been through hell with their bodies and despite that, they are not defined by the challenges they have faced; they are defined by their courage, their resilience and their unshakeable belief in the power of sisterhood.</p><p id=eL3GUvnyua52 data-wc=61>"We are often consumed by negativity, so if I can help build a community of women that uplift one another, I feel fulfilled. Whenever we do a nude catwalk or I finish a new painting, even if only one teenage girl sees this and feels better about themselves, that’s enough for me to feel like I’m onto something that has purpose."</p><p id=enQV7LFAuRI data-wc=12><strong>INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>3 body acceptance experts share how they learned to appreciate themselves</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>The importance of inclusivity</strong></h3><p id=eUSzKfBA5MTk data-wc=24>"In my work, women who have felt marginalised or overlooked by mainstream media finally see themselves reflected in art, validating their experiences and identities.</p><p id=eacLNhcLok2G data-wc=47>"This representation is not only empowering but also helps to normalise bodies that have been historically underrepresented. This sends a powerful message that there is beauty in diversity and that every person deserves to be seen and celebrated for who they are, regardless of their physical appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45de755f44d4-twiggles-sophieteaimg13051.jpg><p id=eNppitkbuWB3 data-wc=21>"In a way, it’s my form of activism because there is no ‘ideal’ body type, true beauty is rooted in diversity."</p><h3><strong>One step further</strong></h3><p id=eQ9C7MAThoFB data-wc=49>Keen to spread her message of body inclusivity further Sophie is taking her art onto the stage at The London Palladium on 5 April, with her show, Send Nudes, comprising storytelling, live painting and audience interaction, aiming to encourage individuals to embrace their bodies as unique canvases of beauty.&nbsp;</p><p id=egHP2dn3wnR9 data-wc=25>"Nervous is an understatement!" Sophie said of her feelings ahead of the show, which will see members of the public take to the stage, naked.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa0a73357cb4-sophie-tea-palladium-still-edited.jpg><p id=etoqJvh0rU0N data-wc=61>"I’m definitely happiest and most comfortable when I am surrounded by my ‘nudies’ all embracing their individuality, however, I always feel pressure to do them justice. I don’t think they even need me, they could strut their stuff on their own but if I have the power to give people the most magical night, I want it to be absolutely perfect."</p><p id=ewMGHZBOHsyV data-wc=62>On the importance of stepping out of her comfort zone for the show, Sophie says: "I think the best things in the world are those that scare you, because it means you are truly onto something so I’m going to go at it with everything I’ve learnt in the past five years painting nudes and make every second on that stage count.</p><p id=eZ9fhNsZpcpd data-wc=62>"There's this underlying fear of messing up or forgetting my lines. But on the other hand, there's a surge of excitement running through me. The energy of the crowd, the adrenaline rush of seeing the nudies backstage, it's all so exhilarating. I know that once I step onto that stage, the nerves will likely fade away, replaced by the thrill of sisterhood."</p><p id=ehyQ28Vuv_c0 data-wc=9><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Find out more about Sophie's show, Send Nudes: Live</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
