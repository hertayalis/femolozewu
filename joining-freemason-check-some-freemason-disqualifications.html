Freemasons trace their origin to the local guilds of stonemasons (one of the oldest ways of construction where the stone is the major material). There are two types of organization. Those who do not accept politicians, religious discussion, women membership and another type of Freemason who accepts all forms of members.</p><h3><strong>How Does A Person Join The Freemasons?</strong></h3><p>Not everyone is allowed into the organization. There are conditions and exceptions too. A minimum of 21 years is accepted for those who wish to join. Another requirement is that, the person wishing to join must be free and of good repute. As already stated, some section of the Freemason does not want religious people involved so any new candidate must declare a belief in a Supreme being.</p><h3><strong>Freemason Disqualifications & Facts</strong></h3><p>Joining the organization is open to every person, however, there are some rules and regulations laid down to govern every member.
