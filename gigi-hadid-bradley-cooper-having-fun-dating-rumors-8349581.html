But, impatient as we all are, those sources say that things are casual for now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They are having fun," a source shared with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "She’s independent, busy, and her days are filled with responsibilities so I don’t see anything serious happening right away if at all.” The same source noted that Hadid has "had sort of a crush on [Cooper] for a while" and could be open to making things a little more serious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[They have] things in common so it’s possible to see it progress," they added. “It appears super casual now, but they both have kids, big careers, busy lives, and understand what life is like in these circles. It’s cute ... and there is an attraction.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The source also noted that Hadid is thinking about dipping her well-heeled toes into acting, which could be another reason that she's cozying up to Cooper. In addition to slaying the catwalk, Hadid is the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>face of Coca-Cola</a>, is mother to daughter Khai, and helms her knitwear brand, Guest in Residence. Adding some camera time to that stacked résumé may seem daunting, but something tells us she'll have no problem juggling it all.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cooper and Hadid were first seen together on Thursday night <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>at celeb-beloved Via Carota</a>. Then, on Sunday, they were seen in an SUV together with Cooper behind the wheel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cooper was last linked to model&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irina Shayk</a>. They dated from 2015 to 2017 and share a daughter together. Hadid was most recently rumored to have been dating Leonardo DiCaprio after the two were seen together at a New York Fashion Week after-party in Sept. 2022.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xqKeomWYlrGqsIybqZqcnJrGbq%2FOqKeeql2drre1zaBkn62eYrGiwMinnmaqpaK8s7%2BMcWptcWVtfg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
