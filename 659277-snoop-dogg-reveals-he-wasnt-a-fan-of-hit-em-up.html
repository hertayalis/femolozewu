Moreover, the song has gone down as one of the most indelible tracks of both the decade and hip history. Indeed, It speaks to the track's longevity that it still gets play to this day. However, Snoop now admits that he wasn't a fan of the track.</p><p>Snoop recently sat down with Big Boy TV to discuss his relationship with Tupac. During the conversation, Snoop recalled being shot at while visiting New York. Despite this, he would later express an interest in working in New York artists after the incident. Snoop revealed that this angered Pac. "I&nbsp;went and did an interview and was asked how did I feel about <a href=# rel>Puffy </a>and Biggie. I was like, ‘I like them n-ggas, I wanna do some music with ’em,'" he said. "And that just rubbed cuz the wrong way, like, ‘N-gga, fuck them n-ggas, them n-ggas tried to kill me.

"Like, you buying more problems, cuh. You buying problems. Gangstas is everywhere. They make ’em everywhere.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Snoop also spoke on his relationship with Pac in the weeks leading up to Pac's death.
