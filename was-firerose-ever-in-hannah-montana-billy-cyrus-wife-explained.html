Despite<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> its morally dubious beginnings</a>, Disney has introduced us to figures like Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Raven Symoné, and perhaps the most iconic star of all: Miss Miley Cyrus. <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hannah Montana</a></strong> served as the launching pad for Cyrus and many others, including <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Firerose</a></strong> — believe it or not.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>If you haven’t heard of Firerose, we can’t blame you; she’s pretty irrelevant to the plot. However, Firerose was indeed on the set of Hannah Montana, but not in the way you might think. While we might know her today as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billy Ray Cyrus’s new partner and Miley’s new stepmom</a> (despite Firerose being only three years older than her stepdaughter, yikes), once upon a time, she was nothing more than a name on-site.</p><h2 id=h-who-was-firerose-in-hannah-montana data-injectable=false>Who was Firerose in Hannah Montana?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hannah-montana-halloween.png><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>While Firerose and Billy Ray Cyrus did meet on the Hannah Montana set, it was nothing more than a coincidence. In fact, the Australian musician — who was 22 at the time — wasn’t part of the Disney Channel show at all. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Firerose</a>, she had just left an audition for Hannah Montana at the Sunset Gala in Hollywood, and Billy Ray, who was walking his dog Tex between shoots, happened to encounter Firerose by chance.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>After striking up a conversation, Billy Ray introduced Firerose to the Hannah Montana producers, hoping to help a budding actress and give her some networking opportunities. At the time, neither of them could have known that 14 years later, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they would be exchanging vows</a>. Back then, the two were merely strangers, with Billy Ray trying to promote a new star in Hollywood.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>Although the actress did not get to join Hannah Montana, she could have. Firerose was 22 years old at the time, while Miley was 19 — the age difference was quite small. Interestingly, a clip from Hannah Montana, where Miley Stewart playfully mocks Robby Ray’s new — and very young — girlfriend, seems quite fitting for this real-life context.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@ryleeb420 href=#>@ryleeb420</a><p>A hannah montana foreshadow no one asked for. <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=mileycyrus href=#>#mileycyrus</a> <a title=billyraycyrus href=#>#billyraycyrus</a> <a title=firerose href=#>#firerose</a> <a title=hannahmontana href=#>#hannahmontana</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - ry" href=#>♬ original sound – ry</a></figure><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=false>The universe operates in mysterious ways, and remember, the only thing separating you and Firerose is that she captured Billy Ray’s achy-breaky heart first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4rdJmnaKqlae8tLGMnq2eql2eu260wKelmqBdoryvwMCnmGaamaG5unnCsqmuq12stqexjJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
