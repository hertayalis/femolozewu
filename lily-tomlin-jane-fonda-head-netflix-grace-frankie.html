With recent developments over at <a title="Amazon Studios news" href=#>Amazon Studios</a> – which saw the retail giant move into original programming and streaming in a big way – it would have been understandable if Netflix had begun to sweat, just a little. But instead of giving a cursory glance over their shoulder to see their competition snapping at their heels, they are moving full-steam ahead, <a title="Netflix and Marvel to team up" href=#>partnering on shows with studios like Marvel</a>, and commissioning impressive original projects, like <strong>Grace and Frankie</strong> – a new comedy series starring Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda.</p><p data-characters=698 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>There is some formidable talent behind this one. Firstly, it is created by the goddess of comedy television, Marta Kauffman, who previously co-created one of the most successful TV shows in television history – Friends. Her co-creator here is Howard J. Morris, who worked with Kauffman on the TV show Dream On, and also has According To Jim and Sullivan & Son on his resume. Secondly, helping out with executive producing duties is industry heavyweight, Paula Weinstein (The Perfect Storm, Bandits, Blood Diamond). Then there are the legendary, award-winning stars themselves – Tomlin and Fonda – who previously demonstrated their entertaining chemistry in the classic film, Nine To Five.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>That chemistry will be given ample room to spark in Grace And Frankie, if the synopsis is anything to go by. Grace (Fonda) and Frankie (Tomlin) are arch-nemeses who find themselves having to reach out and tolerate one another when their respective husbands declare their love for each other and announce plans to marry. Chief Content Officer for Netflix, Ted Sarandos, explained:</p><p>“Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are among the funniest and most formidable actresses ever and it’s an incredible privilege to give them the opportunity to run riot on Netflix. The show created for them by Marta and Howard is warm, very funny and anything but wholesome. We can’t wait.”</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=false>We can’t wait for <strong>Grace And Frankie</strong>&nbsp;either. It’s a strategy that works, and has been proven to do so by such unprecedented successes as House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black – bring together a talented, creative team, throw the weight of Netflix behind them, and exciting results are almost guaranteed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yttcuyZK2nnaG2r3nJmqWeZZaku6WtjKGcmpxdo7K1ssuir2afopawpnnFq5ino5mafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
