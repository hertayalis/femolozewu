But someone who’s lasted the whole stretch of the series so far is Melissa McBride’s Carol Peletier. As comic book fans will know, this is a big change from her fate in the original source material, where she perished after just 42 issues.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>But Carol could have also met an early end in the TV series, too. Back in season 3, she was presumed dead during a walker attack on the prison as, though T-Dog sacrifices himself to save her, we weren’t shown if she survived or not. But in the next episode, we discovered that she was fine. However, there were serious discussions going on in the writers room at the time about whether Carol should make it through.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Scott M. Gimple – who was a supervising producer during that period of the show, though he now stands as TWD‘s chief creative officer – reflected to Looper that he fought for Carol to stick around as he believed that the character’s journey should continue and knew that the series would lose a lot of great material from McBride if she was killed off so soon.</p><p>“There was some investigation going on about killing Carol. It got pretty far down the line and I was pretty hardcore against that,” Gimple said. “Because I saw her journey of going from somebody under her ex-husband’s thumb to being a warrior. It just looked like the most amazing journey for our character to have and having worked with Melissa McBride&nbsp;up to that point, it was like, ‘Oh, well, she could do that. She can do anything.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-walking-dead-episode-1016-amc-promotional-photor-01.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-walking-dead-episode-1016-amc-promotional-photor-06.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-walking-dead-episode-1016-amc-promotional-photor-07.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-walking-dead-episode-1016-amc-promotional-photor-13.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-walking-dead-episode-1016-amc-promotional-photor-16.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TWD_1016_JLD_1113_0990_RT.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TWD_1016_JLD_1113_1492_RT.jpg><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>The showrunner at this point was Glen Mazzaro, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who’s admitted</a> in the past that the decision to kill off Carol got so far along the line that he actually phoned McBride to let her know about her character’s fate. Only later did the writers change their minds and elect to keep her around.
