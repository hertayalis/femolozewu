The seven-year-old youngster told his parents right away.</p><p>On May 25, 2009, the sad tragedy took place. The mother of Exodus attempted CPR and called 911. The little child was brought to the hospital and kept alive by a machine.</p><p>Mike Tyson hurried back to Phoenix, Arizona from Las Vegas. Sadly, at 11:45 a.m. the next day, doctors declared Exodus Tyson dead. She was injured to death.</p><p>Rumors once circulated that Exodus had drowned and died. However, these are all only unfounded conjectures.</p><p>Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill confirmed during a news conference that Exodus was only fiddling with the cables.

There were no grudges held towards anybody. I don’t know how my daughter went dead, and I don’t want to find out. There will be an issue if I can identify the perpetrator of the act.</p><p>If there had been someone to blame for the death of the little child, the shame and hatred would not have prevented either party from moving on.</p><h2><span id=The_proud_father_of_seven_children_Mike_Tyson>The proud father of seven children, Mike Tyson</span></h2><p>The once-pro boxer had seven children, but he now only has six.
