It is also astonishing how the streaming giant consistently hits the mark with shows outside its own turf, yet seems to have a knack for canceling all the promising shows originating from English-language (specifically, U.S. and U.K.) productions.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>As is often the case with Netflix, not all news is good news. While the platform disappoints fans by giving the cold shoulder to highly requested favorites, it relentlessly churns out action movies that receive lackluster receptions and even more underwhelming ratings. Despite this apparent preference for flop films, an eagerly anticipated action movie is once again left out in the cold. But hey, who’s surprised?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>A new Portuguese hit series tops the charts, despite not impressing its native country</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/turn-of-the-tide.jpg><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>In a surprising twist, the current show that has captured everyone’s attention emerges from one of the smallest countries in Western Europe. Turn of the Tide (or Rabo de Peixe) is Netflix’s latest series, originating from the coastal country of Portugal, and it delves into the real-life events that unfolded on the Azores islands. Against all odds, the series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has soared to the top of the charts</a>, mirroring the immediate popularity of Netflix’s international releases like Money Heist and Squid Game.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>As is often the case, perfection remains elusive. The series has also garnered negative reviews from its home country, with viewers finding specific grievances to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pick at within the show</a>. According to some critics, the actors’ accents don’t accurately represent the area of the Azores, particularly the town of Rabo de Peixe, opting instead for actors from Continental Portugal, who hail from the capital city.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>‘Black Mirror’ and ‘One Piece’ live-action finally receive some highly requested new glimpses, but end up haunting everyone’s dreams instead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/black-mirror-season-6-annie-murphy-1.jpg><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>Among the fantasy and sci-fi shows that manage to persevere, we have the ever-thrilling drama series Black Mirror and the highly anticipated One Piece live-action adaptation – though the latter is still awaiting a release date. Both series recently offered glimpses into their upcoming seasons. Interestingly enough, these teasers garnered an enthusiastic response from fans. But it’s not entirely surprising, especially when the image of the new Going Merry keeps playing on a loop in your mind.</p><p data-characters=670 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>After an excruciating four-year wait, Black Mirror has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">finally graced us with a new trailer</a>, building anticipation for its upcoming sixth season. The trailer not only showcases the series’ star-studded cast, but also reminds fans of the mind-bending nature of the show that has a way of distorting one’s own sense of reality. On the other hand, in the realm of live-action, One Piece recently unveiled a new poster featuring the beloved Going Merry. However, despite the attempt to preserve the ship’s original appearance, the cute mascot of the Straw Hat crew <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appears unnervingly creepy</a>, leaving many pondering the necessity of this unsettling change.</p><h2 id=h-the-selection-received-the-axe-even-before-production-began-but-netflix-keeps-investing-in-disastrous-action-films-that-cast-the-trendiest-hollywood-faces data-injectable=false>‘The Selection’ received the axe even before production began but Netflix keeps investing in disastrous action films that cast the trendiest Hollywood faces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-selection-netflix-2.jpg><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>Netflix, always eager to innovate, might want to reconsider its approach. Instead of constantly chasing the newest hit in town, perhaps it’s time for the platform to give attention to the names that have been languishing in the background. Once again, Netflix seems to have surpassed its own limits, opting to cancel fantasy series<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> like Warrior Nun</a> after just a couple of seasons while holding onto titles like Atomic Blonde and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Selection</a> merely to retain the rights to their stories.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Curiously, films like Michael Bay’s 6 Underground, the Russo brothers’ The Gray Man, and Chris Hemsworth’s Interceptor seem to attract Netflix’s investments, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">despite their underwhelming reviews and lackluster fan reception</a>. Surprisingly, these films rarely manage to reach the top of the charts even after their release. And yet, not a word about Charlize Theron’s Atomic Blonde.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=false>On a similar note, another fantasy hit that quickly rose to stardom is still with its fate up in the air and in no hopes of receiving a renewal anytime soon. Shadow and Bone may well be on its way to unknowingly joining the assortment of axed fantasy series that remain in the platform’s graveyard, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">especially after over 76 days of complete radio silence from Netflix</a>, which still has not yet decided upon the future of another of its fantasy shows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytrdOeqq1lnprBp7jIsWSnnaeoeqJ5z6ipra2XqrK0sYyhoK1lo5q%2FqrHSZq6aq5iawG6t1pqwZqyYmnqku8ypnK2hpJ68r3nWoaClnV2brq%2FAwKywZquYpMS0ecaeq2asmJp6osTEZqCnZZaWw7C%2BjKidZpmTqbawuoympq%2BhlWKzrbvPrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
