Taking to the glossy, he referenced the role of his memories in his approach towards partnerships.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actor, who is soon to be seen on-screen in&nbsp;Godzilla vs. Kong&nbsp;and Marvel’s&nbsp;The Eternals, learned the meaning of love the hard way. In his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">conversation </a>with&nbsp;GQ, he shared his mother’s story to describe how he perceives love and marriage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The conversation began by talking about his breakthrough role in the television series&nbsp;Atlanta, released in 2016. After briefly talking about his newly found fame and the entertainment industry, the actor walked down memory lane. He reflected on his bittersweet past to make his point on what love is to him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Henry, whose mother, unfortunately, passed away in 2016, mentioned growing up with divorced parents and continued with how she was unlucky in love. He further addressed the time when his mother was with a man; he mentioned asking her why she was with him despite being mistreated.&nbsp;</p><p>The innocent Henry suggested his mother to leave the guy if he didn’t love her the way he should have.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He added: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I know it sounds skeezy, but she had been on this planet for 68 years and had never experienced a man wanting her or seeing her the way she deserved.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Seeing his mother never experience the love she deserved from a man; hit him hard - it changed his understanding of a relationship’s essence. Henry believes that a relationship where love has faded is not worth the time and energy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And that was what he wanted his mother to understand.&nbsp;</p><p>Soaking into the profundity of the idea of love, the actor made a touching remark: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Love was seeing your mother for the person she was and the person she could be. And love was, in the end, letting go of the idea that someone else would do for you what you would not do for yourself.</p><p>His poignant remark certainly leaves us thinking, who could be the lucky one to date him? Henry, however, hasn’t yet revealed whether he’s dating anyone, but he has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mentioned&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;that he is unmarried.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On the professional side of things, the actor has had a remarkable opportunity to represent a gay superhero in the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) production,&nbsp;The Eternals.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Henry’s representation of Phastos is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">historic&nbsp;</a>for the MCU, as it is the first openly gay superhero representation in the franchise and a crucial step towards gender inclusion in the MCU.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Haaz Sleiman,&nbsp;who plays&nbsp;Henry’s partner in the movie,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">described</a>&nbsp;how their romantic scene made crew members burst into tears. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnkqe2orqMrbCrnZVitaa60bJkoJmpY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
