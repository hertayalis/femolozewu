He then transferred to the University of Nebraska-Kearney (NCAA Division II), where he sat out his junior season due to a medical redshirt. As a junior, he won his first DII title and helped the squad win the team title with a record of 30 wins and 6 losses. As a senior, he won his second NCAA championship and helped his team win the team championship before graduation. Stots believes that his body awareness aided him in quickly transitioning from NCAA wrestling to mixed martial arts. Kamaru Usman, a fellow wrestler-turned-MMA fighter from Nebraska at Kearney, took Stots under his wing as a mentor during his transition.</p><p>Usman’s mother persuaded him to wrestle for Stots because the two wrestlers shared Nigerian origin. Jens Pulver and Pat Miletich were two of the persons who brought Stots to MMA. After becoming pro in May 2015, he went 8-0 before appearing in a regional event that was featured on the Lookin’ for a Fight show in an attempt to sign with the UFC. He went on to win four more fights after losing the first one before joining Bellator MMA.</p><h3><span id=Additional_Appreciation>Additional Appreciation</span></h3><p>Stots chose Bellator over LFA based on where he saw the organization going in the future. Stots acknowledged the fact that he was signed as a prospect rather than a former UFC fighter as a big element in his ability to compete against some of the best in the world. Furthermore, Stots was swayed by the promotion’s Grand Prix tournaments. Stots was scheduled to compete against Magomed Magomedov at Bellator 263 on July 31, 2021. On July 19, it was announced that the battle will be called off. It was rescheduled for Bellator 264 on August 13th.
