Despite not being able to deliver his speech in person, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a32277234/blake-lively-trolls-ryan-reynolds-ponytail-photo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ryan Reynolds" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Ryan Reynolds</a> took to YouTube to share a commencement speech with graduates at this old high school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Addressing Kitsilano Secondary School's class of 2020, Reynolds said, "You've heard the expression 'divide and conquer.' You see it everywhere. And dividing people is just a means to distract them, disarm them, whereby giving one an opportunity to conquer, and the world seems to subsist on this idea more and more and more. And it's getting really fucking boring. It's just overdone and I think that you guys want to be stylish and ahead of the curve. And I believe that your generation will be. So maybe practice the opposite, practice empathy."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actor continued, "Some of you might consider me successful. I don't know some of you might've seen Green Lantern, but I'll tell you this: empathy has gotten me so much more, so much farther." He continued, "To my surprise [empathy] has made me money, friends, priceless memories. It's allowed me to fully accept and provide love. It's helped me recognize the mistakes I've made and learn from them. Above all it made me happy. It's something I'll probably be working on my whole life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Finally, Reynolds offered to buy each and every graduate a large pizza to celebrate their achievements. Basically, the actor tried to make quarantine a little better for some of the students missing their graduations during the coronavirus pandemic, which is pretty adorable.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" title="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
