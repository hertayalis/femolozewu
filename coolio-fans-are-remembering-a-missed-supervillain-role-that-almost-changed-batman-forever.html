But the most fascinating connection between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the ‚ÄúGangsta‚Äôs Paradise‚Äù singer</a> and the comic book world has to be the role he almost played in the canceled fifth Batman movie, which ‚Äî if it had come to pass ‚Äî would‚Äôve changed the DC franchise forever.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>You see, Coolio <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">briefly turns up in Batman & Robin</a> as Banker, the man behind a street race Robin and Batgirl compete in. According to the man himself, this was supposed to be just a brief teaser for a much bigger gig for him in the never-made sequel ‚Äî which would‚Äôve revealed that he was actually playing Dr. Jonathan Crane aka Scarecrow. As the rapper said in a 2017 interview (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>):</p><p>‚ÄúThe only reason I did that part was because they promised me the villain part in the following&nbsp;Batman, which they didn‚Äôt do because Joel Schumacher ‚Äî they fired him.

It has to be said, though, that the director maintained Nicolas Cage was his first pick to play Crane, so it‚Äôs unclear if Coolio really would‚Äôve returned, especially given his admittance that he and the filmmaker didn‚Äôt get on. Still, it‚Äôs weird to think that, in one version of the timeline, Coolio could‚Äôve been our Scarecrow instead of Cillian Murphy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqinnJ68brLAp6pmmaKaerOxzJ6km52inruoecBmpKKro5qxbr%2FUqZyrrpmhuaK1zWapqKSVYsGprdNmmKWln6jBbq%2FHmqWgnZRir6LAzJqlZp6fp7K3sdFo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
