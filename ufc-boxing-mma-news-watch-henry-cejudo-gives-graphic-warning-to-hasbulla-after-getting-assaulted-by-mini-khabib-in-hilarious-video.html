I have officially signed a deal to fight in the UFC! Details will be revealed by the end of the year.” Furthermore, he took this chance to advertise the ‘Hasbulla Fight Kit’.

White <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>said</a>, “</span><i><span>I didn’t know this was coming, but yes we did sign Hasbulla. And what he’s going to end up [whether he fights or not] doing remains to be seen.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Magomedov’s rivalry with Abdu Rozik makes him one of the obvious opponents. Nonetheless, UFC fans are yet to know what Magomedov has to reveal. Fans indeed showed excitement at the news of Magomedov stepping into the Octagon as a fighter.</span></p><p><strong>Watch This Story: </strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Who Is Internet Sensation Hasbulla?
