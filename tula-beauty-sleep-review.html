A big part of my job is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>testing new things</a> and then dishing out all the deets on how they worked for me — I've done it with mascaras, one of which I concluded was better than falsies, and now I'm doing it with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a night cream</a> that's worked nothing short of a miracles on my skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let's preface this: I've tried lots of skincare, and most of the time, I see "meh" results. I'm also very careful about what I use, as I have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sensitive skin that easily gets irritated quickly</a>. But when I heard about a night cream that's essentially <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">beauty sleep bottled up in a 1.67-ounce jar</a> — hence its name, Tula Beauty Sleep Overnight Repair Treatment — I hopped on the first chance I could to try it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It usually takes a while to see results when starting new skincare, so I didn't expect much the first time I used <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the top-rated cream</a>, which has a thick, rich consistency that absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my skin oily. But the next morning, I looked in the mirror and was shocked by how plump, bright, and firm my skin looked, compared to the day before. In fact, when I left my house, I got so many compliments on my complexion. I didn't spill my beauty secret then, but I am now because it's too good not to.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm also not the only one who saw such great results after the first use. Hundreds of reviewers are also blown away by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the effectiveness of this "magical" cream</a> that's a total "game-changer." One shopper wrote, "This overnight [treatment] is the best that I have used. [It] feels like food and nutrition for your skin…Soft, supple skin in the morning."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This was a game changer for me. I break out from EVERYTHING, and [with] this one, [it] has no issues at all," read another review. "I've tried so many products and this one has made my skin brighter, plumper, reduced redness, and reduced my fine lines. My skin feels so hydrated now and has never looked better!" Amen to that.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Eva Thomas</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Tula cream</a> is packed with so many good-for-your-skin ingredients that work wonders on my complexion. Its formula includes probiotic extracts that lock in moisture — which is why my skin looked so hydrated in the AM — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>AHA that firms and smooths</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>vitamin C that brightens</a> and evens skin tone, and Indian gentian, a botanical extract that reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Worth mentioning: I was a little hesitant when I read this was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tula's "most potent" treatment</a> because of my sensitive skin, but it didn't cause any irritation. And that's probably because the cream doesn't contain any yucky ingredients like parabens, sulfates, phthalates, mineral oil, petrolatum, formaldehyde, triclosan, retinol, or gluten.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">my all-time favorite night cream</a> on Tula's website for $68.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMG2uMBmmZ6ZpanGbr%2FLnpypZaKaw6qx1g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
