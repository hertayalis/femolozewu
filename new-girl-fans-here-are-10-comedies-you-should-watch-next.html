The&nbsp;New Girl&nbsp;bug was real, and it infected millions of people worldwide, making us ardent fans of this understated yet irresistible comedy.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>There was more to&nbsp;New Girl&nbsp;than your typical girl-in-the-city story.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zooey Deschanel</a>&nbsp;portrays Jessica Day, the show’s protagonist, with lovable charm and unbounded weirdness. Jess was an eccentric educator who, via a stroke of luck, found herself sharing a loft with three other, shall we say, peculiar male roommates. Since the finale of&nbsp;New Girl&nbsp;in 2018, viewers have longed for another fix of the show’s signature brand of offbeat comedy, likable characters, and heartfelt drama.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Of course, we all know that even the best things eventually end. Thankfully,&nbsp;New Girl&nbsp;has inspired many shows that continue the trend. There are also plenty of series before it that explore similar themes. So, here is a list of the top 10 television shows that are just as likely to win your heart as Jess and her eccentric roommates did.</p><h2 id=h-the-mindy-project-2012-2017 data-injectable=false>The Mindy Project&nbsp;(2012 – 2017)</h2><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>The Mindy Project, a critically acclaimed sitcom from 2012-2017, is a refreshingly original take on the romantic comedy genre. Watching multiple episodes of&nbsp;The Mindy Project&nbsp;in one sitting is the perfect remedy for those who want their love story with a side of belly laughter. Mindy Kaling, a veteran of&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;brand of comedy, gave us Dr. Mindy Lahiri, an OB/GYN whose personality is just as colorful as her clothing.</p><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>However, she wasn’t a&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy-style heroine facing a life-or-death struggle. She was too busy delivering babies while discussing the difficulties of the New York dating scene. Among Mindy’s oddball coworkers are the brusque but affable Dr. Danny Castellano (Chris Messina), the bumbling but compassionate Nurse Morgan Tookers (Ike Barinholtz), and the libertine Dr. Peter Prentice (Adam Pally). Many of the show’s most memorable moments, both humorous and touching, originate in the bonds she forms with these other characters.</p><h2 id=h-two-broke-girls-2011-2017 data-injectable=false>Two Broke Girls&nbsp;(2011 – 2017)</h2><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>The Michael Patrick King and Whitney Cummings sitcom&nbsp;2 Broke Girls&nbsp;debuted on television in 2011 and ran for six seasons until its cancellation in 2017. The show’s two main characters, Kat Dennings’ streetwise and sassy Max Black and Beth Behrs’ sophisticated and once wealthy Caroline Channing provide a constant source of comedy through their unexpected friendship and misadventures. Throughout its six seasons on the air,&nbsp;2 Broke Girls&nbsp;made great use of the contrast between Max (smart and blue collar) and Caroline (high society and naive).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=593 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>The comic timing between Max’s biting sarcasm and Caroline’s genuine upbeat attitude is spot on. The clever mix is complete with the addition of the diner’s supporting cast. Han Lee, portrayed by Matthew Moy, is the diner’s manager, and his many gaffes about American culture and language provide much comic relief. Also, there’s Earl, played by Garrett Morris, who works as a cashier but also used to play jazz and is often the voice of reason. Lastly, Jonathan Kite’s Oleg plays the overly flirty cook who always makes an embarrassing situation hilarious.</p><h2 id=h-shrill-2019-2021 data-injectable=false>Shrill&nbsp;(2019 – 2021)</h2><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>The trailblazing comedy series&nbsp;Shrill&nbsp;is as uplifting as it is funny, masterfully critiquing current events with its distinct voice. The show, based somewhat on Lindy West’s memoir&nbsp;Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman, premiered in 2019 and has since received high praise for its realistic depiction of a young woman coming into her own and finding success in the world. Aidy Bryant of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live fame&nbsp;plays Annie Easton, a plus-size woman with journalistic aspirations, a troubled love life, a mother who is too involved in her life, and a frequently dismissive supervisor.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Annie faces fat-shaming, sexism, and discrimination head-on with courage, humor, and an admirable dose of self-love throughout the series, a rare combination. Even the minor players in Shrill have a significant influence. Fran (Lolly Adefope), Annie’s best friend and roommate, is a stylish and confident LGBT woman who often gives Annie honest, invaluable advice. Their friendship is the show’s emotional backbone, highlighting female friendships’ complexity, resilience, and unwavering support.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-friends-1994-2004 data-injectable=false>Friends&nbsp;(1994 – 2004)</h2><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Just picture yourself in the middle of busy Midtown Manhattan, with a cup of coffee in one hand and the aroma of freshly brewed beans filling the air, surrounded by fascinating friends — this is a snapshot&nbsp;of the famous TV show&nbsp;Friends, which brilliantly captures the spirit of coming of age, platonic relationships, and the occasional romantic triangle. From its inception in 1994 to its finale in 2004,&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;was nothing short of a phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=652 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>The show, developed by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, centers on six friends living in New York City in their twenties and thirties. The cast includes Courteney Cox as Monica, David Schwimmer as Ross, Matthew Perry as Chandler, Matt LeBlanc as Joey, Jennifer Aniston as Rachel, and Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe; all are memorable for their quirks and catchphrases. At its heart,&nbsp;Friends is a story about the experiences that come from relationships of all kinds: romantic, platonic, and otherwise. Changes in the characters’ dynamics throughout the show’s ten seasons contributed to a compelling storyline that held viewers’ attention.</p><h2 id=h-jane-the-virgin-2014-2019 data-injectable=false>Jane the Virgin&nbsp;(2014 – 2019)</h2><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>With its run from 2014 to 2019,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jane the Virgin</a>&nbsp;established itself as an original, energetic, and immensely charming television series that expertly blends romance, comedy, and telenovela-level melodrama. The show, created by Jennie Snyder Urman, is based on the Venezuelan drama&nbsp;Juana la Virgen. Still, it manages to carve out its own niche thanks to its sharp writing, excellent acting, and ability to keep viewers on their toes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Jane Gloriana Villanueva, portrayed by Gina Rodriguez, is at the core of the storm that is&nbsp;Jane the Virgin. A young aspiring author, Jane, gets pregnant from accidental artificial insemination despite being a virgin. This “minor” hiccup, involving a sobbing physician, a daydreaming nurse, and a lost sperm sample, sets in motion an adventure full of surprises and laughter. The show’s telenovela influences are always on display, allowing for several unbelievable story twists, such as the sudden appearance of a long-lost parent and the resurrection of a deceased character.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-chewing-gum-2015-2017 data-injectable=false>Chewing Gum&nbsp;(2015 – 2017)</h2><p data-characters=666 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>The British sitcom&nbsp;Chewing Gum, which aired from 2015 to 2017, is an outstanding example of humor, innovation, and unflinching honesty in its exploration of sexual awakening, coming of age, and personal development among young adults. The show’s originality comes from Michaela Coel’s writing, and the charisma of her leading role makes it a must-see. The show follows Tracey Gordon, a 24-year-old woman from a religious family who grew up in a council estate in London. Tracey is a paradox in that she is both naive and determined, clumsy and adorable, and full of a yearning to experience life beyond the narrow boundaries of her upbringing.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Tracey’s hilarious and often tumultuous quest for sexual discovery and self-understanding is the series’ central narrative arc.&nbsp;Chewing Gum&nbsp;is not only funny, but it also examines issues of race, religion, and social status subtly. The series shows Tracey’s estate as a cosmopolitan village full of life and diversity. Its examination of faith, primarily through Cynthia’s character, is thoughtful and sensitive; it shows the intricate interplay between individual belief, individual liberty, and societal norms.</p><h2 id=h-the-good-place-2016-2020 data-injectable=false>The Good Place&nbsp;(2016 – 2020)</h2><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>From 2016 through 2020, NBC aired The Good Place, a wonderful and philosophically sophisticated sitcom that deftly combines existential questions with fun. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a self-proclaimed “Arizona trash bag,” finds herself in “The Good Place” (a glorious afterlife) after her untimely death on this Michael Schur invention. However, there seems to have been some confusion. Mistaken for another person, Eleanor must now conceal her morally defective past while attempting to become a better person.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Michael (Ted Danson), an architect of the afterlife, creates Eleanor’s world, “The Good Place,” and populates it with other supposedly “good” people like ethicist Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), philanthropist Tahani Al-Jamil (Jameela Jamil), and silent monk Jianyu, later revealed to be a Florida DJ named Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto). Because of how these characters interact with one another, the story is never dull and is always full of surprises, emotions, and laughs.</p><h2 id=h-how-i-met-your-mother-2005-2014 data-injectable=false>How I Met Your Mother&nbsp;(2005 – 2014)</h2><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>From 2005 to 2014,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How I Met Your Mother</a>&nbsp;won over viewers for nine seasons with its unique blend of humor and innovative storytelling. The sitcom, created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, looks at the trials and triumphs of friendship, love, and the early thirties. New York architect Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) tells his two kids the epic, winding, and frequently humorous tale of how he first met their mom.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>This storytelling technique enables the show to tell its story in a way that isn’t chronological, using elements like flashbacks, future exposition, and shifting perspectives. Ted and his group of friends, including the couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), the playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and the independent, career-oriented Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), all bring something unique to the table.</p><h2 id=h-community-2009-2015 data-injectable=false>Community&nbsp;(2009 – 2015)</h2><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Dan Harmon’s&nbsp;Community&nbsp;is a sitcom about a diverse group of college students at the made-up Greendale Community College. The show follows Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), Annie Edison (Alison Brie), Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi), Troy Barnes (Donald Glover), Britta Perry (Gillian Jacobs), Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown), and their study group.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>The unique blend of characters makes for a lively and frequently funny dynamic in the group. The humor in&nbsp;Community&nbsp;is sophisticated and multifaceted; it features a lot of quick wits, visual gags, and complicated jokes that usually call for rewatching. While&nbsp;Community&nbsp;is known for its witty humor, it also has a heartfelt storyline. In between the jokes, the show dives into the characters’ histories and the difficulties they’ve faced in life.</p><h2 id=h-the-big-bang-theory-2007-2019 data-injectable=false>The Big Bang Theory&nbsp;(2007 – 2019)</h2><p data-characters=589 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>The science, pop culture, and everyday social interactions of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Big Bang Theory</a>, a long-running sitcom that aired from 2007 to 2019, are all brilliantly combined to create a comedy that is as appealing as it is educational. The show, co-created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, follows a group of pals who are just as likely to argue over the best Star Trek captain as they are to discuss quantum physics. Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg), and Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar) are the main characters of the show.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=false>When Penny (Kaley Cuoco), an aspiring actress, moves into the apartment across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon, she bursts their geeky, comfy cocoon.&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory&nbsp;draws most of its humor from the sharp contrast between the bookish, awkward scientists and the gregarious, street-smart Penny. As the season develops, the group dynamic changes and deepens with the inclusion of Mayim Bialik’s neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler and Melissa Rauch’s microbiologist Bernadette Rostenkowski.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdZmnqKqnGKzorrSZp%2BeqpVirrOxjGpnZpuforKltcSsZLKnpWLAqbvUpZtmr5GpsKl5zZ6vrWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
