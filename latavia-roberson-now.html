As a key and original member of the group, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LaTavia Roberson</a> rose to popularity and solidified herself in R&B history.</p><p>Alongside LaTavia, <a href=#>Beyoncé Knowles</a>, Kelly Rowland, and LeToya Luckett crafted chart-dominating music, but that changed in 2000. LaTavia and LeToya were dropped from the group due to issues with management. Michelle Williams joined Beyoncé and Kelly and the new Destiny's Child was very successful until they decided to disband in 2005. Of course, Beyoncé went on to become one of the biggest superstars in the world. However, the other members had their own paths to follow, too.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does LaTavia Roberson do now?</h2><p>Other members of Destiny's Child went on to put out solo members, but LaTavia refrained. Instead, she took a detour into television and theater. Her debut was in the 2017 horror movie But Deliver Us From Evil.</p><p>LaTavia also tried to enter the publishing industry. In 2016, she released a boxing magazine called Slugfest Magazine. Unfortunately, it is no longer in circulation.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by LaTavia Roberson (@iamlatavia)</a></p></figure><p>Currently, LaTavia's Instagram boasts that she is a "motivational speaker, musical OG, actress, mother, author, and diva." As part of her entrepreneurial lifestyle, she promotes the Queen Collection for Bouji Lip cosmetics.</p><p>The line includes lipsticks, glosses, and eyeshadow. A clear lipstick appears to be a potential nod to LaTavia's bandmate, Beyoncé, because it is called Renaissance — the name of her most recent album. The products are branded with LaTavia's name.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by LaTavia Roberson (@iamlatavia)</a></p></figure><p>LaTavia was also invited to be a part of the Harvey Foundation's Mothers' Enrichment Summit.
