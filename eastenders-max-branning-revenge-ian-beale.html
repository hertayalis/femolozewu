The beloved Albert Square resident faces being killed off in an explosive Christmas storyline. According to , Max Branning (<a class=hm-link href=#>Jake Wood</a>) is plotting his revenge against Ian - played by <strong>Adam Woodyatt</strong> - after he was wrongly framed over the death of Lucy Beale. A source told the publication: "Max becomes obsessed with revenge and that means wanting rid of Ian - but this time for good. It's a classic old-school storyline that will leave the viewers on the edge of their seats."</p><p style=text-align:center id=efKp9sYFayyp data-wc=11><strong>Max Branning is set to get his revenge on Ian Beale</strong></p><p id=eFgodGclaJu1><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY:&nbsp;Kathy Beale comes face to face with evil James Willmott-Brown</a></p><p id=esmyM_ZZ3J1S data-wc=171>The insider added: "Ian has been top of Max's list since he came out of prison. In the run up to Christmas Max is a man on the edge and takes matters in his own hands when he tries to kill Ian. How Max will try to finish him off is not clear yet, but the episodes are set to be gripping." Over the past few weeks, Max has been taking revenge on various Albert Square residents since he was released from prison. He has since teamed up with James Willmott-Brown, who is on a mission to slowly take over the Square with the help of his family. Soap star Jake, 45, previously teased that his character's revenge storyline could play out on screens for a few years. He told : "All the best storylines that people enjoy are mapped out over a long period. With Max and Stacey - that was always a three-year storyline and Max's revenge is going to play out for at least that long, hopefully."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=etHI9QNcIT1E><a class=hm-link href=#>EastEnders: BBC investigation after script for Christmas special is 'stolen'</a></p><p id=evOCC2trc4FK data-wc=103>Last week, the BBC revealed they have launched an investigation after a script for the ' Christmas special was reportedly stolen and offered to a journalist for money.
