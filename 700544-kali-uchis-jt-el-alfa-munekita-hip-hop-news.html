She also communicated to fans that one project would be entirely in English and the other entirely in Spanish. So far she seems to be living up to all of those promises. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Back in March, she dropped Red Moon In Venus</a> an English language embrace of Kali's R&B stylings. It has a similar sonic palette to her critically acclaimed breakout project Isolation from 2018. Red Moon has features from Omar Apollo, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Summer Walker</a>, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and Don Toliver</a> and the album became Kali's highest-charting project to date when it debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now Kali Uchis appears to be on her way to releasing a second album and just as she promised, it will be in Spanish. Details on the album aren't available yet, but its lead single is officially out. The track is called "Muñekita" and features a pair of guests who make impressive contributions. JT of rap duo City Girls and dembow superstar El Alfa join Kali on the track. Together the trio create a tropical Latin trap banger that fans have already heaved praise onto. The song marks Kali's first new Spanish language song since her 2020 album Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞.
