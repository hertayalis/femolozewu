Since making this move, Jacqueline has maintained a busy work life, predominantly through being an autism advocate, per his <a href=#>Instagram</a> bio. Jacqueline's son, Nicholas — who celebrated his 12th birthday in June, <a href=#>People</a> reported — has autism, so this is a subject that has personal meaning to her. In addition to being an advocate, her bio says that she is also an "Integrative Nutrition Health Coach for families w/special needs."</p><p>Jacqueline frequently posts on social media about&nbsp;how she maintains her health and wellness with the help of the Flat Tummy brand, with whom she has a sponsorship deal. In January, she posted an <a href=#>Instagram</a> photo of herself holding some tea from the brand, and in the past, she's also shared the benefits of eating their gummies.</p><p>Another exciting update on the "RHONJ" star's life now is that Jacqueline became a grandmother in 2016 when her daughter, Ashlee Holmes, gave birth to a son named Cameron,&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a> wrote in 2021. In addition, in 2020&nbsp;<a href=#>The&nbsp;Daily Dish</a>&nbsp;reported&nbsp;that Laurita's son, CJ, who appeared on "RHONJ" was a youngster, had turned 18 years old. This time has just flown by, and Jacqueline has certainly taken on some great new roles since leaving the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG9jaoZ4e9ahmK1lmah6q63CqqyepJmjsm64wK6poqyRYrOzu8xmqaGnnp96pbvIp55mrJ%2BZrrp7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
