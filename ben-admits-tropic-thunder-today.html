But the time we made it was very clear, in terms of for us, the idea behind that character was an actor, it was making fun of an who would actor who would go to any lengths to win an award. For me that was always the very clear idea behind it. Now, does that mean that necessarily now, I would do it today? I probably wouldn’t, because I would know that the atmosphere today would be like, that would feel wrong. But at the time, it was very clear that was what we were doing and felt okay to do it.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/robert-downey-jr-tropic-thunder.jpg alt="Topic Thunder" width=1050 height=548 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Stiller then admitted that Downey Jr.’s performance was the key behind making the character work, because in the hands of a less-talented actor, the point that they were trying to make might not have come across quite so clearly.</p><p>“Now, I’m not saying that that’s okay to do. That doesn’t mean blackface is okay. Blackface is not okay. But it’s probably never okay. So, I have no leg to stand up and say that character is doing that. But for us it was really clear that this is making fun of an actor who would take on any character, just so he could win an award because actors are so self-involved. And I think when we were casting it, it was really clear to me that there are only a few actors who I think an audience would buy doing that and not find it offensive.”</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Cancel culture has been spiralling out of control for a while now, with various movies, TV shows and actors becoming targets <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for seemingly innocuous reasons</a>. <strong>Tropic Thunder</strong> is definitely one of them, because Kirk Lazarus is the embodiment of white privilege in the acting industry and Downey Jr. pitched it perfectly to get that point across without becoming an offensive caricature.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomZ6mXZaxrrXTrGStqp%2BltqR506Gsp5yVp3q1u8OasGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
