Despite being active since 2003, he rose to prominence with the releases of 2021's "Son of a Sinner" and 2023's "Need a Favor." He received additional praise with the release of his song, "Save Me," in which he wears his vulnerability on his sleeve and reveals his emotional turmoil with his lyrics.</p><p>Jelly Roll has since become a major country music star. He has been nominated for and won several country music awards in 2023. In 2024, he was even nominated for two Grammy Awards.</p><p>He continues to rise in the music industry and has even become a staunch advocate against distributing illegal drugs following his own stint with substance abuse. Among his growing achievements, Jelly Roll has also committed to a new fitness journey after running in a 5k race. Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jelly Roll is committed to weight loss after competing in a 5k race.</h2><p>In early May 2024, Jelly Roll competed in a 5k run. The event, titled "2 Bears 5K," was announced by 2 Bears, 1 Cave podcast hosts and comedians <a href=#>Tom Segura</a> and <a href=#>Bert Kreischer</a> and presented by Netflix is a Joke Fest.</p><p>Jelly Roll spoke about his journey during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Entertainment Tonight, in which he divulged how hard he had worked to be able to participate in the event.</p><p>"I couldn't walk a mile when I started trying to do this back in January," he told the outlet. "So the fact that we got 3-point-whatever it was, got it down, I felt really, really good about it."</p><p>He was incredibly proud of himself after completing the run, and it just goes to show how much his hard work and training has paid off leading up to the 5k.</p><p>According to Jelly Roll, he had lost somewhere between 50â€“70 pounds in preparing for the race, which is quite an impressive feat. What's more, he has even inspired others after participating in the run.</p><p>"I think the coolest thing is how many people stopped to tell us that they were motivated by us, other big guys," he told Entertainment Tonight.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>His participation in the 5k came after the country singer stepped away from social media for an extended period. In an episode of her Dumb Blonde podcast, Jelly Roll's <a href=#>wife</a> Bunnie XO revealed that her husband had been bullied extensively for his weight on all of his social media challenges, prompting his break from his platforms.</p><p>At the time, she stressed, "Don't bully people because you never know where they are mentally."</p><p>Jelly Roll has returned to social media following his weight loss and is already super excited to keep running, declaring, "Next year, a half marathon! We're saying it now, absolutely!"</p><p>We wish Jelly Roll all the best as he works towards his fitness goals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KtuNhmqaiknGLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
