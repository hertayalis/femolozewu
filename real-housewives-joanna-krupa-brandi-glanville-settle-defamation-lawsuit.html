"Joanna is happy with the settlement and has no regrets. Joanna hopes she has inspired action instead of indifference."</p><p>While the exact terms of the settlement remain confidential, it seems that a public apology may have been required. Glanville told <a href=#>TMZ</a>, "I want to apologize to Joanna Krupa for the statements I have made about her. I regret ever making such statements about Joanna Krupa; I also certainly never intended my statements to be taken so seriously and out of proportion."</p><p>The 44-year-old continued, "I apologize as I never wanted my statements to affect Joanna Krupa's reputation and I wish her nothing but continued success in life."</p><p>Krupa previously sued Glanville for slander after she appeared on a November 2013 episode of Bravo's <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>, during which Glanville claimed that Krupa, 38, had had sex with Mohamed Hadid while he was married to Yolanda Foster. Glanville also alleged that Krupa's "p****y smelled."</p><p>Glanville later doubled down on these statements in a December 2014 YouTube video. "You can't help the odor situation," she stated (via <a href=#>E! News</a>), regarding rumors about the smell of Krupa's vagina.</p><p>In January 2015, Krupa filed the defamation lawsuit against Glanville, claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeking a minimum of $15,000 in damages.</p><p>Want more reality TV star dirt? <a href=#>Here are all of the Real Housewives' biggest secrets</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHBjaIRwvsSao2agn6rApsPIr5ysZZqkrq%2B6wGaiq62glnqjvsCnm6Jll6Gur8LIpaOeZaOawbW4xGabnp6Roq61tc6nZKWZp6jCqsCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
