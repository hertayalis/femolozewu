If the cap is secured to the sign with a nut and bolt, simply remove the nut with a wrench and keep it in place while you unthread the bolt from the nut and through the sign, as shown in the illustration. If the cap is held on with a rivet, drill off the rivet head and remove the cap from the base plate.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Another issue is, how do you remove the bolts off street signs?</h3><p>Install the monkey wrench(es) in the appropriate location — always remove the bolts from the bottom to the top. If the bolt heads on the sign are smooth and spherical, use your unused hand to grip onto the head. Turning the wrench counter-clockwise will loosen the nut while standing behind the sign will do the trick. If they do not begin to loosen up quickly, do not engage in combat with them.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Furthermore, is it against the law to remove a downed street sign?</h3><p>&nbsp;In most circumstances, sign theft is considered a misdemeanour, and the punishment may include a fine and up to a year in prison. However, if you take a large number of signs, you may be charged with grand larceny, which is a crime punishable by imprisonment in a state jail as well as penalties and restitution.</p><p></p><h3>So, how do you go about removing rivets from a street sign, exactly?</h3><p>To drill into the head of the pop rivet, press down on the drill motor’s trigger and gently rotate the drill motor. When the head of the pop rivet pops free from the surface of the street sign, it is time to stop drilling. Replace all of the pop rivets that hold the street sign in place with new drill bits and repeat the procedure.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>How does it feel when you take a street sign from someone?</h3><p>However unlikely it seems, stealing a street sign will result in an arrest and criminal prosecution, which will be charged as small larceny or theft, depending on the severity of the offence. Those two charges are misdemeanours, which may result in a year in prison and a fine of up to $500 if found guilty.</p><p>PauseUnmute</p><p>Fullscreen</p><p>VDO.AI</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Do road signs have trackers embedded in them?</h3><p>All it is good for is informing you when the sign has been relocated, which is most likely to occur in the event of a theft.

Then, using a tiny punch and hammer, push the pin through the hole until it is partially through it, creating a starting hole for the drill bit.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3>How do you go about replacing rivets?</h3><p>How to Replace Rivets with Screws (with Pictures) Calipers or a tape measure may be used to determine the diameter of the rivet. Installation: Insert the correct-sized drill bit into the motor of the drill and tighten the bit firmly.

Using the pliers, carefully remove the “rivet ring” from the drill bit.</p><h3></h3><h3>Suppose you are caught stealing a traffic cone.
