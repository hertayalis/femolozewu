The Giants brought Doval to the team's alternate training site because they believed he had a chance to make his big league debut. He didn't quite get there, and he got more polish at instructional league in the fall.<p><strong>SCOUTING REPORT:</strong> Doval's fastball has taken several jumps as he's matured, and now the pitch peaks at 102 mph. His slider, a sweepy pitch delivered from a lower, winding arm slot, also flashes plus. Given that his future is in the bullpen, the Giants have encouraged him to divide his pitches at something closer to a 50-50 ratio. More consistent finger placement on the fastball has led to improved velocity and movement patterns. He's toyed with a changeup before, but he should be a two-pitch guy going forth.</p><p><strong>THE FUTURE:</strong> Doval was placed on the 40-man roster after the season and will get his first taste of the upper levels in 2021. He could move quickly enough to make his big league debut toward season's end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufonyxuMCynKurX2l9eH%2BMnJimoZykeqW71ZqjaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
