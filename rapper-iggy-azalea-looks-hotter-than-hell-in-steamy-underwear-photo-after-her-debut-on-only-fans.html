The 32-year-old raised the temperature once again as she teased her fans with a <a href=# rel>steamy underwear snap</a> on the social media platform on Saturday, January 21. Azalea donned a faded blue thong and a matching short crop top that read 'I play the field', flaunting her curves and inked-up body as she gazed at the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Her shiny golden locks were wrapped in a high messy bun with two strands falling on the sides of her face. She added a simple caption: "Hi," and tagged the photographer in the post. Azalea’s makeup was on point as she kept it natural with a nude color on her plump lips.

A second user chimed in: "You're hotter than hell." "Still can’t believe it Iggz!!! You weren’t playing when u said “Hotter Than Hell," a third comment read.</p><p>Meanwhile, a user found a deleted tweet, from 2021, of Azalea where she swears to not join the site despite it "empowering" others. "I think OnlyFans can be really empowering for people. But I will never ever join," she said in the now-deleted tweet, as per the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DailyStar</a>. "I don't want to make that type of content and it only f**** up the bag for people on there who really about that life. Shoutout to the baddies though!!!!!"</p><p>Azalea’s OnlyFans content will cost subscribers $25 per month. The ‘Work’ rapper describes her content from ‘Hotter Than Hell’ as “unapologetically hot,” and largely inspired by '90s Pamela Anderson and Madonna's infamous Sex book.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpGlvaa%2BjKKeoLFdlseiuMSaZKWnn6DAbrTOraueql2ptaK6jKGcpaRdnrtuv9OemKaxXaq7pbHRsJyaql2ltbDAzmaYn6yVp3qpsdFmm56apal6sLqMqKWlsV2brq%2B%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
