At the time, tabloids were running rampant with rumors that the baby had been born with health problems or birth defects. Eventually, the media circus grew so crazy that Prince's record company finally acknowledged that, yes, Prince and his then-wife, Mayte Garcia-Nelson, had given birth. Nothing was mentioned about the boy's condition, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>Media outlets then began reporting that the baby had died. The&nbsp;<a href=#>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</a>&nbsp;obtained what it reported to be the child's death certificate, on which the baby's name was listed as "Boy Gregory." It was also reported that the child had died seven days after birth from Pfieffer syndrome, Type 2, a "rare skull deformity resulting from a genetic mutation."</p><p>Garcia later wrote in her memoir,&nbsp;The Most Beautiful: My Life with Prince&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>), that they had named their son Amiir, and their baby boy's death was something that greatly affected Prince. "I don't think he ever got over it," she wrote. "I don't know how anybody can get over it. I know I haven't."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhbIBwucCnsGarlZi%2FpsDSZqeroZ6Ysm7A0aKcnWWYnrGmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
